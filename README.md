# 🏌️ Digital Heroes — Golf Charity Subscription Platform

A full-stack web platform where golfers subscribe to monthly prize draws, record Stableford scores, and direct a portion of every payment to a charity of their choice. Built with **Next.js 16**, **React 19**, **Prisma**, **Stripe**, and **Tailwind CSS 4**.

## ✨ Features

| Area | Highlights |
|---|---|
| **Subscriptions** | Monthly & yearly plans via Stripe Checkout; webhook-driven status sync |
| **Stableford Scores** | Users record their last 5 rounds (1–45 each) — these double as draw entry numbers |
| **Monthly Draws** | Admin-run draws (random or score-weighted); 3/4/5-match tiers with transparent prize pool splits |
| **Charity Giving** | Configurable charity share (10–100%) per subscriber; charity directory with featured spotlight |
| **Winner Claims** | Proof upload, admin verification, and payout tracking |
| **Payment Allocation** | Every payment is split live: prize pool → charity → platform, viewable in the user dashboard |
| **Admin Panel** | Full admin dashboard for managing users, draws, charities, scores, claims, and payouts |
| **Glassmorphism UI** | Premium dark-mode design with glass effects, micro-animations, and responsive layouts |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- **npm** (comes with Node)
- A **PostgreSQL** database (Supabase free tier works great)
- A **Stripe** account (test mode is fine for development)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/digitalheros.git
cd digitalheros
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in the values:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Supabase **transaction pooler** (port 6543) — runtime / app connections |
| `DIRECT_URL` | Supabase **direct** Postgres (port 5432) — required so `prisma migrate deploy` works (Vercel build + local migrations). Copy from Supabase → Database → Connection string → URI. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | A strong random secret for signing auth tokens |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Your app URL, e.g. `http://localhost:3000` |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe secret key (`sk_test_...`) |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Stripe webhook signing secret (`whsec_...`) |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | *(optional)* Resend API key for transactional emails |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | *(optional)* Sender address for emails |
| `ADMIN_SIGNUP_KEY` | *(optional)* Shared secret required to create an **admin** account via `/signup`; leave empty to disable admin signup |

> **⚠️ Important:** If your database password contains special characters (`@`, `:`, `/`, etc.), you must percent-encode them in the connection URL. See `.env.example` for examples.

### 4. Set up the database

```bash
# Run migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Seed with sample data (charities, admin user, etc.)
npm run db:seed
```

### 5. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## 🔐 Admin access

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| **Admin URL** | `/admin` — after login, admins are sent here automatically (member routes like `/dashboard` redirect admins to `/admin`). |
| **Login** | Go to `/login`, choose the **Admin** tab, and sign in with an account that has role `ADMIN`. |
| **Seed admin (local dev)** | After `npm run db:seed`, a default admin exists if the email was not already used: **Email:** `admin@digitalheroes.local` · **Password:** `Admin@123` · **Name:** Platform Admin. |

**Creating additional admins:** Set `ADMIN_SIGNUP_KEY` in `.env`, open `/signup`, select **Admin**, and enter the same key in the admin-key field. Without a key, admin signup is disabled.

**Admin panel sections** (single page with jump navigation; some URLs redirect to the matching anchor):

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Reports** | Draw / financial reporting |
| **Charity payouts** | Charity payout tracking |
| **Users** | Subscribers, subscriptions, plan overrides |
| **Charities** | Directory, featured, metadata |
| **Draws** | Create and publish monthly draws |
| **Verification** | Winner claims, proof review, payouts |

**Shortcuts:** `/admin/users`, `/admin/charities`, `/admin/draws`, `/admin/winners`, and `/admin/reports` redirect to the corresponding section on `/admin`.

> **Production:** Change the seeded admin password (or remove the seed user and create admins via `ADMIN_SIGNUP_KEY`). Never rely on default credentials in production.

## 💳 Stripe Setup

1. Create a [Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) and grab your **test** API keys.
2. Set up a webhook endpoint pointing to `<your-url>/api/stripe/webhook`.
3. Listen for these events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `invoice.paid`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
4. Copy the webhook signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env`.

For local development, use the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli):

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```
